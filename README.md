MusicMuse is a full stack web application which aims at providing users with a comprehensive music streaming experience. It incorporates various features like user authentication, music exploration, playlist creation, premium membership, and seamless payment integration.
Frontend: Utilized HTML, CSS to design and implement the user interface.
Backend Development : Created controllers to manage routes and process frontend requests, interfacing with a service layer for business logic. On the backend side, I have utilized Spring Boot, a Java-based framework, to build RESTful APIs for handling various functionalities of the application. The backend controllers, such as NavController, PaymentController, PlaylistController, SongController, and UserController, are responsible for managing routes and processing requests from the frontend. These controllers interact with the service layer, which contains business logic for user management, playlist management, song management, and payment processing.
Database Integration: The application utilizes a relational database - MySQL to store user information, songs, playlists, and payment-related data. I have integrated the backend with the database using Spring Data JPA, which provides an abstraction layer for working with databases in a Spring application. The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve data related to users, songs, playlists, and payment transactions.
User Authentication and Authorization: The application features user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access to user accounts and resources. Users can register, log in, and log out of their accounts using email and password credentials. The UserController validates user credentials and assigns appropriate roles (admin or customer) based on user privileges. Authorized users can access premium content and features available in the application.
